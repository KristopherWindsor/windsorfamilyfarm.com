New resolutions, new plants, new animals, new adventures! We hope you find an excuse to come visit the farm this year. From scheduling family tours to class fieldtrips to Farm Camp, we have something for kids of all ages.
This comment from a family that had their daughter's birthday party at our place: "Thank you so much for hosting the BEST 6th BIRTHDAY Party ever! Your hospitality, kindness, patience and of course fascinating animals were so wonderful..."
