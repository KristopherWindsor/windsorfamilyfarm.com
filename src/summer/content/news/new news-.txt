We had a baby boy lamb born yesterday! He's doing well. Check our facebook page for updated pictures! Since we  only have one ewe, this is our annual excitement.
Just ordered 25 baby chicks...arriving in March. I couldn't resist!
Check out our new camp schedule. We have 4 weeks for you to choose from for camp, a Tea Party, and a preschoolers' 1-day camp.
