Happy St. Patrick's Day! (Do you know Saint Patrick wasn't even Irish?) Instead of green beer, we choose to celebrate with green eggs and farm fresh corned beef!
Please let us know soon if you're interested in pork or beef. We are taking orders now.
We have an awesome new line-up of summer camp options. They'll be posted by April 1st (no foolin').
As always, thank you for choosing Windsor Family Farm products!
