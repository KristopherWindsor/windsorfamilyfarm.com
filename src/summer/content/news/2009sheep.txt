Exciting times around here! Saturday, March 7, we had a baby boy lamb born to Daisy. On Thursday, March 12, we had another boy lamb born to Lily! They are very cute and cuddly. Denver, about 9 yrs old, is the daddy sheep. We had the first lamb in the house for a couple days, trying to fatten him up. He's so cuddly!
