Farm Camp is an exciting time for kids to come explore, be exposed to animals, learn, play and create.
We are offering 3 weeks of Farm Camp, 1 week of Nature Camp and 1 session of Princess Farm Camp. Please go to our Tours/Camp link for more information.
The 2 day camp is full, as well as the June 21st week and July 12th week. This leaves the Princess Camp (June 28), Nature Camp (July 5-9) and Farm Camp (July 19-23). Please note the change in the last camp session: it will be Farm Camp and not Nature Camp.
