With Fall behind us and Christmas upon us, we are looking forward to offering you more products in the Spring and Summer. During the fall, we give our land and animals a rest from activity but are anticipating getting more pigs soon!
If you --or someone  you know-- love pork, please check our swine page for information on ordering.

We hope 2011 has been a good year for you and we pray that 2012 will bring you amazing surprises and great memories!
Merry Christmas!!
