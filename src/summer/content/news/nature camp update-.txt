Last chance to sign up for "Nature Camp"! This will be a fun week of crafts, exploring, doing a variety of things on the farm, but not necessarily related to the farm animals. We have changed the format to Monday-Wednesday, July 5-7.
It'll be from 9:30-12:30,for $75 for all 3 days, including lunch. Contact us if you're interested (kimwindsor@gmail.com).
