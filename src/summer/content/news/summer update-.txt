Summer is in full-bloom! Our corn is growing, flowers blooming, chickens laying and Farm Camp is happening!
It's not too late to join us for this week's camp! We are going to have a great variety of crafts,  learning and activities.
Or, if you'd like a shorter camp experience, we are offering a 3 day camp for new or experienced campers :-). This will be Mon-Wed, July 9-11, 9:30-12:30 for $80. I need 10 kids to sign up to make this happen!
