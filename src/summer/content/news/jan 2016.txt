 We are thankful for the rain, which we have been missing! But, alas, the ground is very muddy! The animals have plenty of dry ground and they get the same food, rain or shine! Check out the links on the website as we have updated them recently.
We are anticipating having  a beautiful Spring, so book your class fieldtrip or Party soon! We have some new critters as well...you need to check out our Facebook page for all the lastest events and new animals!

And if you'd like some pork this summer, please reserve your pig  today.
