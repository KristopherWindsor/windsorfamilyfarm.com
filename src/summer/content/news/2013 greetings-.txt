We have weathered all the rain and freezing nights that December and January have brought us! Now it feels like spring and we're getting the yard fixed up and ready to house more critters!
We will be getting steer and pigs soon so please check those links to learn how you can enjoy fabulous meat! (Order yours soon. Meat will be ready late summer 2013.)
Windsor Family Farm greatly misses ZAK, our first goat, who was known and loved by many. He died January 8th, 2013.
We welcomed KASEY, our newest little lamb, on January 7, 2013. Daisy is such a good mama to her lambs each year.
Transition isn't ever easy but we chose to downsize our assortment of chickens. We currently have bantams of various breeds (including Cochins and Silkies), Aracaunas and Marans. Our egg supply is available to whomever wants to stop by and purchase some! $4/doz or $3/doz for small eggs.
Let us know when you'd like to come visit!
