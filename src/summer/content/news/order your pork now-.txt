You really want Green Eggs and Ham, don't you? Our eggs come in a variety of colors and you can order your ham (and various pork choices) NOW. We only get a limited number of baby pigs to raise. If you're interested, check out our "Swine" page. The meat will be ready around February 2009. Check our site often for updates on the pigs!
We recently bought these cute little "Gloucester Old Spot" breed of pigs. They were raised at an organic farm in Watsonville, free to roam the pasture with their mama pig, not stuck in a concrete pen. This is a heritage breed, originally from England. They're great pasture pigs and produce great bacon!
