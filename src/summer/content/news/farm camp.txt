Coming for one day! Saturday, December 6th at 10am, we're going to have a Winter Wonderland Party. This will be an abbreviated "farm camp" day, where we'll do crafts, play games and have fun with animals. We'll have structured time from 10 to 12, then you have the option of staying until 1:00 to bring a picnic and have free play time. Cost is $10 per child and parents do NOT have to stay but can if they'd like to.
Please RSVP to Kim at 686-0800 or kimwindsor@gmail.com
