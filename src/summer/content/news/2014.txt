
Spring is here early! We have had a dove born, some baby chicks and then twin lambs! The Farm life is bustling!
We are working on dates for Spring events and for Summer Camps. Check back soon for updates.
Feel free to email kimwindsor@gmail.com if you have questions or comments about Farm Camp or want to schedule a private party.
Also, check out our Facebook page for the latest pictures and events at the Farm.
