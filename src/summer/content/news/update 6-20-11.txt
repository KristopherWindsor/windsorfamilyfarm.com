The week of June 27th Farm Camp is full; the week of July 11th has a few spots left. The Fieldtrip Camp is still a great option for adventure! If you're interested in just  a couple days, let us know. Farm Princess Party date has been changed to July 29th. We hope to see lots of little girls come that day!
We also are able to host Birthday Parties!
Thanks for your support of our family farm.
