Roses are blooming, chickens are nesting and critters are growing!
Sign up for Farm Camp soon to get the week that's best for your family. Every week is suitable for first-timers and returning campers; the first week is just for those who haven't been here before. (The first week is now full). Each day we will  have a fun craft, learn some amazing things about animals and have a great time together!
Fieldtrip Camp, new this year, will be an adventure in learning about food and agriculture (includes an excursion to a nursery and Fresh Choice Restaurant).
Check the Tours/Camp link for more information and registration form.

Also, last chance for awesome beef and pork! Contact us with your questions (kimwindsor@gmail.com).
