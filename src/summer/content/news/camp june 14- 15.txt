We are offering a 2-day FARM CAMP for those who aren't able to come for a full week. This is geared toward 5-7 year olds. We're going to learn about chickens, rabbits, sheep and goats...do crafts, have fun, have lunch and give your child a great farm experience! Cost is $40 for both days. We will meet from 9:30-12:30 Monday and Tuesday, June 14 and 15.
There are 14 lucky kids who are registered and we'll have a great time; the bad news is, this camp is full.
