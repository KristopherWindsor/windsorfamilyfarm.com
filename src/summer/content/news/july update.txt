We have had a fantastic time with all the Happy Campers this summer. We've enjoyed making little sheep with real wool and sticks, drawing all the farm animals, feeding the steer, sheep and goats, and learning about fruits and vegetables!!
For next week, our Boys' Camp, we are full! Look back here frequently for updates of events on the farm.
And if you want excellent beef, let us know!
