Farm Camp is done and we're gearing up for FAIR next week. Please come to the SANTA CLARA COUNTY FAIR August 5th-8th. Check out thefair.org for more information. We still have pork available for your freezer!! (check out our swine link) Or if you'd like to attend the auction at fair on the 8th, that's a great opportunity to encourage the youth of 4H as they've worked hard to raise these animals.
