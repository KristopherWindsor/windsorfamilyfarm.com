[h]Fieldtrips[/h]
When was the last time you (or your children or students) got up close and personal with chickens, pigs, goats, sheep and cows??!? We love hosting groups of curious kids (and adults). The look on a child's face when they hold a chicken is priceless. Sometimes people tell us about their fond memories of visiting a farm when they were young. Because most of us don't really know where our food comes from, we offer educational fieldtrips so the kids can learn and enjoy the animals. We love hosting parties; we’ve hosted birthday parties, school fieldtrips, homeschool groups, and 4H groups. The kids love feeding the critters, petting them and asking lots of questions. If you’d like a more educational, structured visit, we have posters, worksheets, specimens, skeletons and various hands-on activities. It’s refreshing to see others enjoy our country life, learning about where our food comes from, what the animals eat, what they feel like and what habits each of the animals  has. We feel very blessed to have this property and like to share some of what we’ve learned while developing our little farm! 
It is recommended that your group plans to come for 2 or 3 hours. Packages can include a craft (prices vary: $15 per family/minimum $50 for the visit or $5/child for school groups). All income goes directly back to caring for the animals! Call or email us for more information or to schedule your group's visit. kimwindsor@gmail.com
[h]Farm Camp[/h]
This is a lot of fun for kids, ages 5 to 10, to learn more in-depth about various farm animals and row crops. We have a small farm,(in San Martin, south of Morgan Hill), but we pack in a variety of food grown and animals raised. The format is Monday through Friday, from 9:30 to 12:30.  We have small groups so the children get individualized attention and everybody has fun! We do crafts, learn about a fruit each day, create healthful snacks, learn about a different animal each day and have some play time.
