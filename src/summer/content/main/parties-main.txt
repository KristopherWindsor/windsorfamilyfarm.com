Instead of having a farm-themed party for your child, why not bring the kids to the farm? We have a great place for kids to explore, touch animals and have fun. You can customize the package for what you want this party to be! 
 
We live just south of Morgan Hill, where we have our little family farm. We're big enough to have some amazing animals and yet small enough that you won't lose your children...they'll be in sight all the time. They have fun; the adults can relax.

When the kids come, they can run and play. Then we'll have a little tour where they can touch the animals and ask questions. Following that, you're free to play games or they can play on the playground or in the playhouse or do lawn games. We can provide a craft or activity sheets. It's  your party! 

Cost is $200, which includes full use of the facilities for up to 3 hours and an age-appropriate craft for 12 children. Please contact us about availability and then send a $75 deposit and we will make this a great event for you!
If you'd like a wonderful pony experience on top of our farm experience, contact sparkleponyparty.com (Shelley) or miniature horses can come to your party: contact sonrisastables.com (Karen)
