Meet our Pygmy Goat, Zak! He is sweet-tempered and always ready for a treat! Pygmy goats are much easier to maintain than larger goats—since the larger ones tend to break through fences, devour roses, and sneak any grain they can find. They’re most known as being pets. Boer goats are generally for meat; Nubians, Nigerian Dwarfs and other larger goats are best for weed eating and for milk. We got Zak  one  Christmas but thought he was lonely (he’d come to the patio door looking for a friend). We bought Karmel (who was carmel colored as a baby) and he didn't care for her! So then we got a little doe (girl) Boer goat, named Zoe.  We built their own little barn.

Unfortunately, Zak died January 8th, 2013. He was the best goat and very sweet ~ better than a dog!

Our latest goats are triplets, born to our neighbor's goat, Spring 2012. Come meet Luke, Leila and  Luna, the sweetest "Nigerian Dwarf" goats!
