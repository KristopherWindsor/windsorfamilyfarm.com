Our sheep are Suffolk, one of the most common breeds. Denver, our ram (male sheep), sadly died June 6, 2011. He was about 11 years old. Emmy, who was our very shy ewe, had Daisy in 2005 and she gave birth to Lily in 2007. Daisy was a twin but we sold her brother. I guess twins run strong in our family. Daisy has since given us four boys: Valentino 2/15/08, Austin 3/7/09, Mac 2/7/10 and Kody (2/8/12). In 2013 Daisy surprised us with a baby in January!We named her Kasey (because we love K names!).
Two years ago, Daisy gave birth to twins! A boy and girl, born January 24, 2014. They are extremely cute and fun to watch! 
Last year, Daisy had boy/girl twins again: Joey and Jasmine, born January 17, 2015.
It's amazing to watch their development-they were eating alfalfa already at 1 month! But of course, still nursing as well.

 (Lily had her first baby 2 days after her 2nd birthday! 3/12/09. Unfortunately, we sold Emmy and Lily in 2009)
We sheer them every spring and then they all look so young and trim. They eat grass hay or alfalfa, or pretty much anything green. Once a year we give them and the goats a vaccine to keep them healthy. They are our noisiest critters, always begging for food or attention. They always love a good back rub. Our sheep are  what we call "consumers" because the only thing they give back is entertainment!
The babies' feet are soft like rubber and will harden up as they walk around. Their fur is bumpy and not very soft. They will turn white like their parents. 

 We have 2 "Babydoll Southdown" sheep, a ewe named Trixie (2/23/13)and her baby ram named Tex (2/5/16). Tristin (2/21/13), the best little ram ever, died in 2015, due to over-eating grain. This unique breed has a very different look and feel from our other sheep.
